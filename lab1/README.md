# Lab RDFS entailment

To be delivered in pairs: a .zip file containing :

- a report.pdf file where you explain how you tested the different RDFS entailment rules in the RDFS recommendation with human.rdf and human.rdfs or the data of your choice, i.e. with which SPARQL queries and with which differences in the results of the queries, and which CONSTRUCT queries to implement RDFS entailment.

- a select.txt file containing your different SPARQL queries of type SELECT to test the differences in the results.

- a construct.txt file containing your SPARQL rules of type CONSTRUCT implementing the RDFS semantics.

- the RDF files of your choice if different from human.rdf and human.rdfs.
